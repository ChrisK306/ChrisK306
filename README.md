- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, That Guy, CyberNaught 2077
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been helping my dad fix cars before I reached double digits in age. I played Cyberpunk 2077 4 times over, and have played Fallout 4 countless times, Skyrim countless times, Outerworlds 3 times, and Fallout 76 for 3 playthroughs and one ongoing playthrough today. Yes, I've played Fallout New Vegas, yes it's great, and no I still don't think it's better than Fallout 4. Lastly, and most importantly, my interest in cybernetic enhancement and development is heavily influenced by CyberPunk. I would love to help bring cybernetic implants and to world as soon as possible.
